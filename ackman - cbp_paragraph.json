contributing to reasonable suspicion, the fact that rental
cars are “often used by narcotics traffickers”); United
States v. Williams, 271 F.3d 1262, 1270 (10th Cir.2001).
Contributing to the suspiciousness of Mr. Powell s use of a
rental vehicle in this case is the fact that he rented a GMC
Yukon but told Deputy Trammel that he owned a Chevy
Suburban—essentially the exact same vehicle—which he
left at home. As Deputy Trammel observed, the fact that
Mr. Powell rented a Yukon instead of using his Suburban
for the trip undercut the plausibility of his story:
[The vehicles are] equal in size, which
that was another thing that I took
note on, is that if you ve got a vehicle
of the same size, why would you pay
all the money to rent a vehicle? He
had the same vehicle sitting at home

vehicle here wasn t completely full

of room. And in comparison, it was
actually the same.

duration in light of Mr. Powell s stated travel plans: he
rented the Yukon in Colorado on May 15th, the traffic
stop occurred in Kansas on the 16th, Mr. Powell stated
he was driving to Kentucky to move there and start a
business, and the vehicle was due back in Colorado on the
18th. Deputy Trammel testified:
You know, he s stating that he s
moving to Kentucky to start a
business. There s really no way on a
three-day rental that he has, being
one single driver by himself, any
time at all to conduct any business,
other than pretty well drive straight

drive straight back. I didn t—and he
also rented it both ways.
Appellee s Supp. App. at 25. The three-day rental
agreement would essentially require Mr. Powell to drive
the 1,190 miles from Denver to Lexington, unload the
vehicle, and turn right around and drive 1,190 miles back.
See Contreras, 506 F.3d at 1036 (considering “suspicious
at best and incredible at worst” defendant s claim “to
have driven more than 1,200 miles to see her family,
only to turn around within a day and begin the 1,200–
mile drive back”). Mr. Powell argues that the rental
agreement does not suggest criminal activity because it
is physically possible to make the trip in that amount of
time, he could have miscalculated the necessary *787
time but later called the rental company to request an
extension, or he could have chosen to be late returning
the vehicle. Certainly, these are all possibilities, but under
our precedent, the duration of his rental agreement,
combined with the length of his trip, gives rise to a degree
of suspicious conduct sufficient to contribute at least
something to the reasonable suspicion calculus.

that an amount of luggage seemingly inconsistent with the

v. Jones, 44 F.3d 860, 863, 872 (10th Cir.1995) (three

(10th Cir.1986) (“very little luggage” suspicious in light
of claim of being on vacation). Here, Mr. Powell told
Deputy Trammel that this was his first trip and he would
be making a second trip with his Suburban, and he argues
on appeal that an individual may also legitimately choose
to mail or ship his or her belongings for a cross-country
move. But these explanations, while not implausible, do
not entirely answer the question why one would make an
initial cross-country trip to transport only half a vehicle of
items if one plans on making a second trip and possibly
shipping other items. As Deputy Trammel asked when
testifying before the district court: in common experience
doesn t one usually pack things in tightly on the first trip
to assure there will be room in the second trip for the
remainder? Under our governing authority, an apparent
(even if conceivably explicable) inconsistency between the
stated purpose of a trip and the amount of luggage being

in San Diego and was to be dropped off in Omaha.

Here, Mr. Powell told Deputy Trammel that this was his first trip and he would be 
making a second trip with his Suburban, and he argues on appeal that an individual 
may also legitimately choose to mail or ship his or her belongings for a cross-country 
move. But these explanations, while not implausible, do not entirely answer the question 
why one would make an initial cross-country trip to transport only half a vehicle of items 
if one plans on making a second trip and possibly shipping other items. As Deputy 
Trammel asked when testifying before the district court: in common experience doesn’t 
one usually pack things in tightly on the first trip to assure there will be room in the 
second trip for the remainder? Under our governing authority, an apparent (even if

219 F.3d 1171, 1179 (10th Cir.2000)). Williams distinguished its facts from Wood in this 
manner:
[In] Wood, [the] panel concluded that the officer’s testimony as to the defendant s 
*709  rapid breathing, trembling hands, and throat-clearing constituted a mere 
“generic claim of nervousness,” and therefore discounted the nervousness as a 
factor in its reasonable suspicion analysis. 106 F.3d at 948. In Wood, however, 
the officer and the defendant engaged in casual conversation, including a 
discussion of the good rate the defendant had received on the rental car. Id. At 
944. Thus, Wood appears to have involved the more common situation where a 
citizen exhibits initially “signs of nervousness when confronted by a law officer,” 
id. at 948, but then tends to “settle down” as the traffic stop continues. See West, 
219 F.3d at 1179. In this case, the district court found credible the officer s 
testimony that Mr. Williams  extreme nervousness did not dissipate throughout 
the entire stop. Given our standard of review, the record supports the district 
court’s finding that Mr. Williams  nervousness exceeded that of the average 
citizen during a routine traffic stop. While we do recognize that “nervousness 
alone cannot support reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,” United States v.

[6]  ¶ 4 We begin our analysis by noting that neither
party disputes the legality of the initial traffic stop.
Furthermore, during a traffic stop, an officer may order
the driver out of the vehicle in the course of conducting
the stop and issuing a citation. See Commonwealth v.
Freeman, 563 Pa. 82, 757 A.2d 903, 907 n. 4 (2000). During
traffic stops, officers often observe facts that lead them
to a reasonable suspicion that some alternate criminal
activity is afoot, and therefore, the officers prolong their
encounter with the driver although the purpose of the
initial traffic stop has been achieved. Recently, courts have
been asked to examine these subsequent interactions to
determine their legality.
¶ 5 In the instant case, the Commonwealth concedes that
Defendant was seized at the time that he gave Officer
Clee consent to search the vehicle. 1  Brief for Appellant
at 10 (stating that “the subsequent interaction between
police and [Defendant] was merely a continuation of
the initial lawful detention”). Thus, the Commonwealth
argues that the seizure was valid, as it was simply a
continuation of the initial traffic stop. Defendant argues

757 A.2d 903 (2000), our Supreme Court has used these
principles regarding seizure to examine a subsequent
citizen/police interaction following a valid traffic stop.
In these cases, the Court recognized that the transition
between detention and a consensual exchange can be
so seamless that the untrained eye may not notice that
it has occurred. Although there may be no question
regarding the validity of the initial traffic stop, the
crucial question is when the validity of that stop ceased.
Where the purpose of an initial, valid traffic stop has
ended and a reasonable person would have believed
that he was free to leave, the law characterizes a
subsequent round of questioning by the officer as a
mere encounter. Since the citizen is free to leave, he is
not detained, and the police are free to ask questions
appropriate to a mere encounter, including a request
for permission to search the vehicle. However, where
the purpose of an initial traffic stop has ended and
a reasonable person would not have believed that he
was free to leave, the law characterizes a subsequent
round of questioning by the police as an investigative
detention or arrest. In the absence of either reasonable
suspicion to support the investigative detention or
probable cause to support the arrest, the citizen is
considered unlawfully detained. Where a consensual
search has been preceded by an unlawful detention, the
exclusionary rule requires suppression of the evidence
obtained absent a demonstration by the commonwealth
both of a sufficient break in the causal chain between
the illegality and the seizure of evidence. This assures of
the search s voluntariness and that the search is not an
exploitation of the prior unlawful detention.

standard for determining whether reasonable suspicion
exists:

reasonable suspicion existed, our Courts remain
mindful that the officer s judgment is necessarily
colored by his or her primary involvement in “the
often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.” In

S.Ct. 1868[, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)]). Therefore, the
fundamental inquiry of a reviewing court must be an
objective one, “namely, whether ‘the facts available to
the officer at the moment of the [intrusion] warrant a
man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action
taken was appropriate.’ ” Commonwealth v. Zhahir, 561

¶ 10 In attempting to bolster Officer Clee s suspicions, the
Commonwealth relies on inconsistencies in Defendant s
rendition of what occurred on his trip to New York.
However, these inconsistencies *815  were revealed in
the course of the second round of questioning and were
not known to Officer Clee at the time that the purpose
of the initial traffic stop ended. Furthermore, while the
Commonwealth claims that Officer Clee “recognized the
smell of bactine as being produced from cocaine,” the
trial court found that although Officer Clee thought the
bactine smell came from “either some kind of chemical
or, conceivably, some kind of masking scent, he was not

alleged crack cocaine that [he] realized that what [he]

else[.]” N.T., 5/23/02, at 46. Therefore, at the point in

The legality of a traffic stop is examined under the two-
pronged analysis described in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S.
1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). See United
States v. Brigham, 382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004)
(en banc). First, the court examines whether the stop
was justified at its inception. Id. Second, it determines
whether the subsequent action was reasonably related to
the circumstances that justified the stop or to dispelling a
reasonable suspicion that arose during the course of the
stop. Id. at 506–07. Reasonableness is determined in light
of the totality of the circumstances. See id. at 507.
As part of a traffic stop, a police officer may request a
defendant s driver s license, insurance papers, and vehicle
registration; run a computer check on those documents;
and issue a citation. United States v. Shabazz, 993 F.2d
431, 437 (5th Cir.1993). The officer may ask the defendant
about the purpose of his trip, and may also ask about
unrelated matters so long as the questioning does not
prolong the stop. Pack, 612 F.3d at 350. When the purpose
of the stop is resolved, “the detention must end unless
there is additional reasonable suspicion supported by
articulable facts.” United States v. Gonzalez, 328 F.3d 755,
758 (5th Cir.2003).
Davis does not dispute the propriety of the stop or
subsequent computer check of his driver s license and
license plate. He contends, however, that the detention
became unconstitutional when Smith continued to detain
and question him after electing to issue a warning for
the traffic violation. For support he relies on this court s
decision in United States v. Valadez, 267 F.3d 395 (5th

for speeding, justified computer checks. See id. Because
Davis was stopped for speeding and concedes that Smith
was justified in running a computer check, Valadez is
inapplicable.
The relevant caselaw is that which helps us analyze
whether Smith possessed reasonable suspicion to justify
his detainment of Davis after running the computer check
Factors such as nervousness, inconsistent stories, crimina
history, use of another s vehicle, an out-of-state driver s
license and license plates, and presence on a known drug-
trafficking corridor may not suffice to create reasonable
suspicion of criminal activity. See United States v. Cavitt
550 F.3d 430, 434, 437–38, 438 n. 5 (5th Cir.2008); United
States v. Santiago, 310 F.3d 336, 338, 342 (5th Cir.2002)
United States v. Jones, 234 F.3d 234, 237–38, 241–42
(5th Cir.2000). Instead, to constitute “articulable facts
that support a reasonable suspicion” of wrongdoing, such
factors must be coupled with “more concrete evidence
that suggests the commission of a specific offense.” *299
Cavitt, 550 F.3d at 437 (citation and quotation marks
omitted).
We find guidance in our caselaw as to the sort of “concrete
evidence” that will establish reasonable suspicion. In
several cases we upheld prolonged detentions when
officers utilized their experience and training to identify
evidence that a vehicle contained drugs, such as alterations
to gas tanks or tires. See United States v. Escareno
Sanchez, 507 F.3d 877, 882 (5th Cir.2007), vacated on other
grounds, 553 U.S. 1029, 128 S.Ct. 2428, 171 L.Ed.2d 227
(2008); United States v. Estrada, 459 F.3d 627, 632 (5th
Cir.2006). We also have upheld extended detentions when
factors such as nervousness and presence on a known
drug-trafficking corridor were coupled with the fact that
the defendant provided false or implausible information
regarding his travel plans. 1  See Pack, 612 F.3d at 352
361; United States v. Fishel, 467 F.3d 855, 856 (5th

In addition to Davis s nervousness, criminal history,
and presence on a known drug-trafficking corridor, the
government also emphasizes factors that it contends
make this case more similar to the cases in which
this court has upheld prolonged detentions. Those
factors include Davis s inconsistent answers regarding his
criminal history, his implausible travel plans, and the
circumstances surrounding the pit bull in his car.
The first two factors likely do not suffice to establish
reasonable suspicion. Although Smith indicated that
Davis made inconsistent statements regarding his criminal
history, he did not identify the statements, their
inconsistencies, or the reason they aroused his suspicions.
In contrast, the officers in Brigham and Pack identified
specific inconsistencies, including contradictions in the
statements made by the driver and his passengers
regarding travel plans, conflicts in the driver s own
statements, and fabrications about a passenger s identity.
See Pack, 612 F.3d at 345–46; Brigham, 382 F.3d at 504–
05.
The evidence of the implausibility of Davis s travel plans
is also minimal. Smith said he doubted that Davis was
traveling to Dallas to visit his uncle because he had
a dog with him and his car looked “lived in.” The
district judge expressed skepticism about this explanation.
Later, while addressing the prosecution, the judge noted
that Smith “couldn t explain why” the trip appeared
implausible. He also noted that a car s “lived in” look
“doesn t mean anything.” These observations comport
with our precedent, which holds that travel plans whose

justify an extended detention. See United States v. Jenson,
462 F.3d 399, 404–05 (5th Cir.2006).
More compelling are the circumstances surrounding the
pit bull in Davis s car. Smith knew from prior training
that such dogs are often used to deter car searches when
transporting narcotics. Additionally, Davis warned Smith
twice that the dog was not friendly. During the second
such instance he was sitting in Smith s patrol *300  car,
and Smith had not asked about the temperament of the
dog or indicated that he intended to approach Davis s car.
Thus, when Davis abruptly reiterated the warning, Smith
reasonably suspected that Davis was attempting to deter
him from recovering illegal materials contained within the
car.
We recognize that dogs accompany many travelers, and
that if those dogs are unfriendly toward strangers, most
owners would advise those approaching their vehicles
to be wary. But the additional, out-of-context warning
issued by Davis while sitting inside Smith s patrol car
sets this case apart from the typical example. Taking this
interaction together with the other factors enumerated
by Smith, including Smith s training regarding dogs and
Davis s nervousness, criminal history, and presence on
a known drug-trafficking corridor, we hold that Smith
possessed reasonable suspicion to prolong Davis s stop
until the canine unit arrived.

argument amounts to an attack on Trooper Green s
credibility. But the district court found Trooper Green s

the perfume smell therefore constituted an articulable

for the proposition that the “ ‘extreme nervousness  factor

district court actually agreed, saying that all of the listed
factors “are certainly of limited value by themselves,”
but together, were properly considered as part of “the
totality of the circumstances.” This is entirely consistent
with Damato, in which we said that each of the factors
considered might be “innocent,” but “under the totality
of the circumstances test, individually innocuous factors
can combine to arouse a reasonable suspicion for the
experienced officer.” Id., ¶ 26, 64 P.3d at 710. Based
on all of the circumstances, the district court concluded
that “Trooper Green possessed the articulable suspicion

[6]  The government argues that Guerrero was never

further asserts that Guerrero was not subjected to the
threatening presence of several officers, the display of any
weapons, any physical touching, or the use of language or

request was compelled. See United States v. Johnson, 326
F.3d 1018, 1021–22 (8th Cir.2003) (listing circumstances

Jones, 269 F.3d at 925. The district court concluded
that Guerrero s inability to understand English, Bardsley s
statement “before you take off,” and the fact that Bardsley
continued to talk to him and ask questions while Guerrero
was sitting in the back seat of the patrol car would
reasonably lead a person in similar circumstances to
believe that they were not yet free to leave. We agree. Most
English-speaking people, and *590  certainly Guerrero,
who was having trouble understanding Bardsley, would
not have understood that the stop ended and a voluntary
interaction with Bardsley began. See United States v.

suggested that he was trying to conceal the fact that
he had rented the car in a city known to be a source
for narcotics. Trooper Jimerson testified that California
is a known source state for narcotics; he also testified
that the fact that Mr. Wood s car had California license
plates and registration was of no significance to him.
Furthermore, the trooper did not indicate, nor is there any
evidence in the record, that Sacramento is regarded as a
source city for narcotics, while San Francisco is not. Mr.
Wood s error might also be suspicious if other information
provided to the trooper contradicted his explanation. E.g.,
Kopp, 45 F.3d at 1453–54; Sanchez–Valderuten, 11 F.3d
at 989. No such evidence supports the district court s
conclusion; indeed, under the district court s reasoning,
Mr. Wood caused suspicion both by making the error in
the first instance and by “later promptly admitt[ing]” his
mistake. Once Mr. Wood corrected his error, suspicious
inconsistencies virtually evaporated and any justification
his error yielded for further investigation dissipated.
The district court also concluded that the presence of
fast-food wrappers and open maps in the passenger
compartment contributed to a finding that reasonable
suspicion existed. Mr. Wood informed the trooper of his
travel itinerary—a cross-country trip through parts of the
country he had not seen before. The presence of open
maps in the passenger compartment is not only consistent
with his explanation, but is entirely consistent with
innocent travel such that, in the absence of contradictory
information, it cannot reasonably be said to give rise
to suspicion of criminal activity. See Karnes v. Skrutski,
62 F.3d 485, 495 (3d Cir.1995). Remnants from fast-
food restaurants can probably be found on the floor of
many cars traveling the interstate highways, including
many traveling eastbound on Interstate 70. See id. at 496
(Fast-food wrappers “have become ubiquitous in modern
interstate travel and do not serve to separate the suspicious
from the innocent traveler.”). The possession of open
maps and the vestiges of fast-food meals describes a very
large category of presumably innocent travelers, Reid,
448 U.S. at 441, 100 S.Ct. at 2754, and any suspicion
associated with these items is virtually nonexistent.

v. Hall, 978 F.2d 616, 621   n. 4 (10th Cir.1992).
Trooper Jimerson had no prior acquaintance with Mr.
Wood which enabled the trooper to contrast Mr. Wood s
behavior during the traffic stop with his usual demeanor.
Hall, 978 F.2d at 621; Bloom, 975 F.2d at 1458. “We
have repeatedly held that nervousness is of limited
significance in determining reasonable suspicion and that
the government s repetitive reliance on ... nervousness ...
as a basis for reasonable suspicion ... must be treated with
caution.” Fernandez, 18 F.3d at 879 (citation omitted).
Thus, Mr. Wood s demeanor during the detention must be
discounted given the generic claim of nervousness.
The remaining factor relied upon by the district court
was Mr. Wood s prior narcotics convictions. Although
Trooper Jimerson subsequently received more detail
about the number of times Mr. Wood had been convicted,
and an indication from the El Paso Intelligence Center
that Mr. Wood was a known narcotics trafficker, at the
time he detained Mr. Wood the trooper knew only that
Mr. Wood had a narcotics record. The trooper inquired
about that record, and Mr. Wood promptly and truthfully
responded to the inquiries.
We have previously cautioned that prior criminal
involvement alone is insufficient to give rise to the
necessary reasonable suspicion to justify shifting the focus
of an investigative detention from a traffic stop to a
narcotics or weapons investigation. Lee, 73 F.3d at 1040;
Sandoval, 29 F.3d at 542. “If the law were otherwise,
any person with any sort of criminal record ... could
be subjected to a Terry-type investigative stop by a law
enforcement officer at any time without the need for any
other justification at all.” Id. at 543. Given the near-
complete absence of other factors which reasonably gave
rise to suspicion, the fact that Mr. Wood had previously

After stripping away the factors which must be

simply do not accord any nervousness on the part of
Mr. Kaguras much weight in the analysis, particularly
because so much of what contributed to the trooper s
characterization simply does not differentiate this case
from any other innocent motorist stopped by a state
trooper.
The trooper also testified that Mr. Kaguras s failure
to show sufficient relief after receiving a warning also
was indicative of continued nervousness and reasonable
suspicion. Id. at 83. The government presses a similar
argument concerning reasonable suspicion. Aplee. Br. at
16. We do not decide this dubious proposition because
when the trooper observed this lack of relief, the trooper
had already issued the warning and was detaining Mr.
Kaguras after he had fulfilled the “mission” of the
original, justified stop. Observations made during an
illegal detention cannot be used to bootstrap reasonable
suspicion. As such, we decline to even consider Mr.
Kaguras s “continued nervousness” in our analysis.
The record does not support the characterization that Mr.
Kaguras s travel plans were vague, evasive, implausible or
inconsistent. See e.g., Aplee Br. at 19; Aplt.App. at 123.
Mr. Kaguras maintained throughout the entire traffic stop
that he was going to Chicago to visit his girlfriend, and
that the length of his stay depended on how things in their
relationship developed. Aplt.App. at 104 (Q: [to Trooper

Although the government properly notes, Aplee. Br. at 19
that unusual or implausible travel plans, or inconsistent
answers about travel plans, can give rise to reasonable
suspicion, Sokolow, 490 U.S. at 9, 109 S.Ct. 1581, *789
United States v. Kopp, 45 F.3d 1450, 1454 (10th Cir.1995)
that simply was not the case here.
**6  The government also argues that Mr. Kaguras
“stuttered [ ] like he was trying to think of something
to say” and repeated the questions the trooper asked
him regarding the rental contract s return date. Aplt.App
at 81. We decline to consider this in our totality of
the circumstances analysis because this conversation
transpired after the Trooper had issued Mr. Kaguras the
warning, and therefore after the point at which he needed
reasonable suspicion to continue to detain Mr. Kaguras.
Moreover, the amount and size of luggage in Mr
Kaguras s car was entirely consistent with his travel plans
The government s position that the “two large, plastic
containers, the enormous, black suitcase and the large, red
duffel bag were not consistent with an ‘indefinite visit,’ ”
Aplee. Br. at 18, is untenable. An indefinite visit could be
for days or months or years and there was no basis for
the trooper to regard the amount packed as suspicious
or for the government to categorize it as inconsistent. 2
The situation here is entirely different than those where
“luggage” was properly considered as a factor giving rise
to reasonable suspicion. See United States v. Sharpe, 470
U.S. 675, 687, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (car
appeared overloaded and the back of the car was weighed
down); United States v. Mendez, 118 F.3d 1426, 1431 (10th
Cir.1997) (no luggage either in trunk or back seat on a long
distance trip could be suspicious). Nor can we endorse the
district court s observation that large luggage inherently
gives rise to suspicion because it might be used to carry
marijuana which requires a lot of space. Aplt.App. at 124
136.
The trooper further cited Mr. Kaguras s travel from
“one known drug source area to known drug source
area destination” as a factor giving rise to reasonable
suspicion. Id. at 105. The district court relied upon this
and Seattle s proximity to British Columbia in its analysis
", "position":5 },
"14983":{"case_id":"14983", "opinion_id":"3351965", "text": "Id. at 124 (“Now, we ve got to take into consideration
that Seattle is very near the providence [sic] of British
Columbia, where British Columbia marijuana is very
desirable on the drug market. I would think that that
would be quite important.”), 135-136. In Santos, where
travel between a drug source location (San Francisco)
to a drug destination (New York City) was cited as a
factor justifying reasonable suspicion, we cautioned: “If
travel between two of this country s largest population
centers is a ground on which reasonable suspicion may be
predicated, it is difficult to imagine an activity incapable
of justifying police suspicion and an accompanying
investigative detention. Our holding that suspicious travel
plans can form an element of reasonable suspicion should
not be taken as an invitation to find travel suspicious per
se.” Santos, 403 F.3d at 1132 (emphasis in original). The
idea that the source city is in close proximity to another
source city is even weaker. Indeed, the trooper admitted
that “every place uses drugs” and that the “vast majority
of places on the west coast” are sources of drugs. Travel
between major cities is perhaps the weakest factor in the
totality of circumstances analysis, *790  and is entitled to
practically no weight.
**7  The mere fact that Mr. Kaguras s vehicle was rented,
Aplt.App. at 79, is of no value in assessing whether the
trooper had objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal
activity, and is not a factor on which reasonable suspicion
can be legitimately predicated. Similarly, the trooper s
testimony that he thought it was “odd,” id. at 75, that Mr.
Kaguras had extra keys affixed to the rental car key chain
contributes nothing to the reasonable suspicion analysis.
No evidence appears as to why extra keys attached to the
key chain are indicative of criminal activity. The trooper s
explanation is inadequate: “Most people I have stopped
that drive rental cars don t have extra sets of keys on the
key chain to the rental car. And me personally renting
cars, I don t put my extra set of keys on there.” Id.
Also unavailing is the trooper s observations of food
wrappers in the car, and the district court s reliance
thereon. Bradford, 423 F.3d at 1157 (“[F]ast food
wrappers have become ubiquitous in modern interstate
travel and do not serve to separate the suspicious

"14985":{"case_id":"14985", "opinion_id":"3351965", "text": "from the innocent traveler.”) (internal quotations and
citations omitted). The suspicion associated with fast
food wrappers is “virtually nonexistent.” Wood, 106 F.3d
at 947. The trooper testified that he thought the food
wrappers were significant because he s “seen that people
traveling across the country with illegal narcotics try to do
so as quickly as they can and they generally just eat on the
go.” Aplt.App. at 90. Even with deference to his training
and experience, the trooper conceded that Mr. Kaguras
had left Washington two days prior, a reasonable amount
of time to cover the distance in question, and that in light
of that, the presence of food wrappers wasn t “worth very
much.” Id. at 104.
The scent of air freshener, standing alone, is inadequate
to support reasonable suspicion absent other indicia of
criminal activity. United States v. Villa-Chaparro, 115
F.3d 797, 802 (10th Cir.1997). The fact that a rental car
had a strong odor of air freshener might reasonably cause
an officer to be suspicious, but in this case, there is no
actual indicia of criminal activity. We also note that the
trooper did not testify as to any air fresheners in the car,
and thus the scent could just as easily have been from
cleaning the car prior to rental. 3
As a whole, in totality, these factors do not give rise to
objective, reasonable suspicion. Although we will consider
factors that could have an innocent explanation, there
must be something to indicate that criminal activity is
afoot. While state troopers  training and experience are
important, suspicions and hunches like those proffered

stop. Id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1612, 191 L.Ed.2d at 496.
There, a police officer had pulled over the defendant s
car for a traffic violation upon observing the vehicle
temporarily veer onto the shoulder of the highway. Id.
After running a records check on both the driver and the
lone passenger, and writing a warning for the driver, the
officer asked for permission to walk his dog around the
vehicle. Id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1613, 191 L.Ed.2d at 497.
The driver refused, whereupon the officer detained the
vehicle s occupants for another five minutes until a deputy
sheriff arrived. Id. At that point, the officer led the dog
twice around the car and the dog alerted to the presence
of drugs on the second pass. Id. Although both the district
court and the court of appeals upheld the dog sniff
under the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court found
that Rodriguez s motion to suppress should have been
granted because law enforcement had unconstitutionally
prolonged the traffic stop. Id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1613–

written warning and the dog alert on the vehicle was
approximately seven to eight minutes. Id. at ––––, 135

that the officer did not have individualized suspicion of
criminal activity prior to the dog sniff, and for purposes
of appeal, the Eighth Circuit assumed this to be the case.

distinguished a prior case upholding a dog sniff that had
occurred while the state trooper was in the process of
writing a warning ticket. See id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at

‘become[s] unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time

Thus, *393  in Rodriguez, the Court confirmed that an
officer “may conduct certain unrelated checks during an
otherwise lawful traffic stop” but “may not do so in a way
that prolongs the stop, absent the reasonable suspicion
ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individual.”
Id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1615, 191 L.Ed.2d at 499.
Unrelated checks, the Court explained in Rodriguez,
are matters that do not “serve the same objective as
enforcement of the traffic code: ensuring that vehicles on
the road are operated safely and responsibly.” Id. A dog
sniff, unlike matters such as “checking the driver s license,
determining whether there are outstanding warrants
against the driver, and inspecting the automobile s
registration and proof of insurance,” can only be
undertaken without individualized suspicion if it does not
prolong the traffic stop. Id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1615,

plans, and his failure to disclose the
full facts about his criminal history.
Id. at 859–60.
This case shares some characteristics of Briasco but is
distinguishable in other respects. On the whole, one can
fairly say the grounds for suspecting Saccento and Pardee
of other criminal activity before they were detained for
the dog sniff were not that strong. That probably explains
why Trooper Vander Weil said they were free to go.
More importantly, it appears the most significant ground
for suspecting Saccento and Pardee of criminal activity
had to be the information they provided on their travel
plans during the vehicle stop. We are not persuaded that
the knowledge Trooper Vander Weil possessed at the
beginning of the stop—the California plates, the slowing
down to sixty-five miles per hour, the failure to make eye
contact with the trooper, the oversight of leaving the right
signal light on after pulling over, the initial nervousness,
the lived-in look of the vehicle, or the air freshener—
provided reasonable suspicion alone or in combination.
Much of the conduct observed here would be typical of
any motorist who is approached and then pulled over
by state law enforcement. Many motorists slow down,
decline to make eye contact, and get nervous when a
state trooper draws near. See United States v. Guerrero,
374 F.3d 584, 590 (8th Cir.2004) (noting that nervousness
during a traffic stop is of “limited significance”).
Briasco can be contrasted with the Eighth Circuit s
decision in United States v. Beck, 140 F.3d 1129 (8th
Cir.1998). In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered
whether seven factors gave rise to reasonable suspicion
warranting a renewed detention following the issuance of
a warning for a traffic violation. Id. at 1136, 1140. Those
factors were: (1) an absent third party had rented the
car driven by the defendant, (2) the car had a California
license plate, (3) fast food trash was on the floor of the car,

provide a basis for an ongoing detention. Id. at 1137–39.
The lived-in look of Saccento and Pardee s vehicle, to
judge by the photographs that are in the record, was
unremarkable given the occupants were clearly on a cross-
country trip. There were water bottles, an energy drink,
a metal coffee cup, chips and dip, apples and bananas,
a trash bag with some trash, a sleeping bag draped on
the rear seat, and a guitar case. Many vehicles are more
lived-in than that. The video recordings of the stop also
tend to dispel any impression that the occupants were
unusually apprehensive (until the narcotics sniffing dog
was called in around 10 a.m.). While the strong odor
of air freshener was certainly a relevant consideration,
alone it would not support detention of the occupants
beyond the time required for the traffic stop. See Frazier
v. State, 236 P.3d 295, 301 (Wyo.2010) (“The presence
of odor suppressing agents, alone, does not give rise to

(finding reasonable suspicion when scent of air fresheners
was “overpowering,” trooper still detected the odor of
marijuana, driver acted extremely nervous, and vehicle
belonged to absent third party). In short, we cannot find
that Trooper Vander Weil had developed individualized
suspicion of criminal activity at the outset of the stop when
he first encountered Saccento and Pardee in person.
[6]  If we conclude, as we must, that reasonable suspicio
could potentially exist only if one weaves in the verbal
answers given by Saccento and Pardee regarding their
travel plans and their respective criminal histories, we then
need to decide whether that information was obtained
only because Trooper Vander Weil prolonged the stop
beyond what was reasonably necessary to carry out his
traffic-related mission. See Rodriguez, 575 U.S. at ––––,
135 S.Ct. at 1616, 191 L.Ed.2d at 500. In United States
v. Evans, 786 F.3d 779 (9th Cir.2015), the Ninth Circuit

the driver a warning and told him he was “good to go.”
Id. at 783. However, the deputy then asked the driver if
he had any contraband in the car, mentioning marijuana,
cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin. Id. When the
driver denied the presence of contraband but refused to
consent to a search, the deputy performed a dog sniff. Id.
at 783–84. The canine alerted at 7:33 p.m., twenty-four
minutes after the stop began. Id. at 784.
The Ninth Circuit concluded that the deputy had
prolonged the stop beyond what was reasonably necessary
to perform his traffic-related mission, specifically noting
that the deputy had called in an ex-felon registration
check at 7:20 p.m., that the check took eight minutes,
that the check was not related to the traffic grounds for
the stop, and that the deputy used the time to question
the defendant and see if there were inconsistencies in his
story. Id. at 786–87. The Ninth Circuit therefore found
that the stop was invalid under Rodriguez unless the
deputy s “prolongation of the traffic stop was supported
by independent reasonable suspicion.” 9  Id. at 789.
Similarly, in People v. Pulling, the Illinois Appellate
Court applied Rodriguez to uphold the granting of
a motion to suppress after finding that a trooper
“unlawfully prolonged the duration of the stop when
he interrupted his traffic citation preparation to conduct
a free-air sniff based on an unparticularized suspicion
of criminal activity.” 393 Ill.Dec. 670, 34 N.E.3d 1198,
1201 (Ill.App.Ct.2015). There, the trooper initiated a
traffic stop for speeding. Id. at 1199. According to the
trooper, writing a speeding ticket generally only took
between three or five minutes, although the required
time would have been longer because it turned out
the driver had a suspended license. Id. The trooper
admitted that about four minutes into the stop, he had
all the information necessary to prepare both citations.
Id. at 1201. Yet he stopped writing the citations, and
instead conducted further questioning, which detected
inconsistencies, before performing a free-air sniff. Id. Even
though the entire stop consumed only fifteen minutes, the
court found the unrelated activity *396  had prolonged
it, and the results of the dog sniff therefore had to be
suppressed. Id. at 1202.

Id. at 1119–20. The trooper admitted that the “blending”
prolonged the stop. Id. at 1120.
This case involves a similar blending. At 9:33 a.m.,
Trooper Vander Weil had all the information he needed
to prepare warnings and had told the vehicle occupants
he was only going to issue warnings. By Vander Weil s
admission, he could have gone back to his patrol car
at that point and completed his traffic-related mission
without Saccento s or Pardee s involvement except for
a signature on the warning citations. Instead, he asked
Saccento to come with him. He then questioned Saccento
for five minutes in his car before calling in the information
for a warrants check and a criminal background check
at 9:38 a.m. 10  The response to the warrants check came
back at 9:42 a.m. From 9:43 to 9:44 a.m., it appeared
that Trooper Vander Weil was in the process of preparing
the warnings because he asked Saccento to confirm the
year of the Toyota. At 9:50 a.m., the warnings were
complete and printed out. At this point, Trooper Vander
Weil left Saccento in the vehicle, approached Pardee, and
conducted separate investigative questioning of him for
three minutes. Then, at 9:55 a.m., twenty-five minutes
after pulling the vehicle over, the trooper returned to
the vehicle and told Saccento he was free to go. Given
all this, and Trooper Vander Weil s admission that the
entire stop would have taken only about ten to twelve
minutes if he had been focused on issuing the warnings,
the stop was clearly prolonged within the meaning of
Rodriguez. See 575 U.S. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1612–

We must then ask whether individualized suspicion to

See id. at ––––, 135 S.Ct. at 1616–17, 191 L.Ed.2d at
501 (remanding for consideration of whether reasonable
suspicion supported detaining defendant beyond time
required to complete traffic stop). We find that it
would not have existed. As we have already noted, the
information Trooper Vander Weil had at the outset of the
stop did not support more than a detention to process the
traffic violations. And in his early questioning, all that
Trooper Vander Weil had been told was that Saccento
with the help of his companion was moving home from
California to New Jersey in multiple *397  trips. No
inconsistencies—even minor ones—had been developed in
the occupants  story. While Saccento s stated plan to move
home from California to New Jersey in multiple trips may
not have been “cost-effective,” as Trooper Vander Wei
later testified, we cannot say this factor, even when added
into the considerations the trooper was aware of when
he made the stop, amounted to reasonable suspicion of
drug trafficking. See Beck, 140 F.3d at 1139 (holding that
an officer s disbelief of a driver s explanation for traveling
even when coupled with other factors was not enough to
give rise to reasonable suspicion).
The State urges that Saccento s and Pardee s crimina
histories—which apparently disclosed that each had at
least a prior drug-related arrest—also enter into the
reasonable suspicion calculus. It is not clear when Trooper
Vander Weil received these histories via email but we find
it would not have been earlier than 9:44 a.m. That is when
dispatch, having provided the answer to the warrants
check at 9:42 a.m., was asking the trooper whether
Saccento and Pardee were both white. This occurred over
ten minutes into the stop.
On our independent review of the record, we are convinced
that a stop in this case directed only at the traffic-
related mission—i.e., checking driver s license, vehicle
registration, insurance, and outstanding warrants, and
preparing warnings—would have taken no more than

question of whether an officer s objectively reasonable
suspicions developed during a traffic stop are nullified
when the officer indicates to a driver he is free to
leave. 3  In Williams, a Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper
stopped a car for speeding. Id. at 1264. During the traffic
stop, the trooper observed several factors which raised
his suspicion the defendant may have been transporting
drugs: (1) the defendant exhibited exceptional or extreme
nervousness throughout the duration of the stop; (2) the
defendant had a walkie-talkie type radio commonly used
by people driving in tandem; (3) the name on the car rental
agreement did not match the name on the defendant s
driver s license; and (4) the defendant s unusual travel
plans. Id. at 1265. Despite his suspicions of criminal
activity, the trooper returned the driver s license and car
rental agreement to the defendant. Id. “In addition, the
[trooper] said something to the effect of, ‘Thanks a lot.
We ll see you.’ ” Id.
The trooper then asked the defendant if he would answer
a few more questions, and the defendant agreed. Id. The
trooper first asked whether the defendant “was carrying
any contraband or large amounts of cash.” Id. The
defendant said no. Id. Then the trooper asked if he could
search the car, which the defendant refused. Id. At that
point, the trooper told the defendant he would detain
him until a drug-sniffing dog could arrive and sniff the
outside of the car. Id. Approximately fifteen minutes from
the time of the initial stop, the drug-sniffing dog “arrived
and eventually alerted to the trunk area of the” car. Id.
A search of the trunk revealed several large bales of
marijuana. Id.
The defendant moved to suppress the marijuana. Relying
on the trooper s observations made prior to the trooper
returning the defendant s travel documents and verbally
indicating the defendant was free to leave, the district
court held the trooper had sufficient reasonable suspicion

In rejecting the defendant s argument, the Tenth Circuit
stated:
Mr. Williams fails to cite any
case, nor can we find any,
suggesting that the return of such
documentation negates an officer s
objectively reasonable suspicions
developed during a traffic stop.
Although the record indicates that
the [trooper] subjectively intended
that Mr. Williams was free to go, the
relevant inquiry in this case is based
on the objective facts known to the
[trooper], not upon the [trooper s]
subjective state of mind .... Whether
the [trooper] never intended to
release Mr. Williams or whether
he simply changed his mind after
the consensual questioning does not
alter our analysis if the [trooper]
already had sufficient reasonable
suspicion to detain Mr. Williams
for the purpose of the canine
drug search. We therefore conclude
that the [trooper s] indication to
Mr. Williams that he was free
to leave bears no significance in
our determination of whether the
[trooper] had reasonable suspicion

reasonable suspicions developed by a police officer during

law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion when

*3  Here, the totality of the circumstances supports
Deputy Woodward s reasonable suspicion of criminal
activity. At the suppression hearing, Deputy Woodward
testified several factors made him suspect the group he
stopped may have been trafficking illegal drugs. As he
approached the vehicle, Deputy Woodward noticed a
blanket covering the items in the back. When Karina
opened her window, Deputy Woodward detected “a
very heavy odor of air-freshener” and saw two of the
passengers light cigarettes. Based on his training and
experience, Deputy Woodward suspected the group might
have been trying to physically hide illegal drugs with the
blanket and mask their odor with multiple air fresheners
and lit cigarettes. See, e.g., United States v. Bloomfield,
40 F.3d 910, 918-19 (8th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (explaining
an officer is “able to attach significance to the strong

v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124 (2000) (“[N]ervous, evasive
behavior is a pertinent factor in determining reasonable
suspicion.”). He also found the group s travel itinerary
suspicious because they made a “last-second decision” to
drive to Las Vegas and were driving several thousand
miles and spending four days in the car to spend such
a short time in a city known as a source for illega
drugs. See, e.g., United States v. Carpenter, 462 F.3d
981, 987 (8th Cir. 2006) (concluding “nervous” behavior
and “unusual and suspicious” travel plans provided
reasonable suspicion to justify the brief detention of
a traveler to conduct a dog sniff). Given the totality
of the circumstances in this case, the Court agrees
with the magistrate judge that Deputy Woodward had
sufficient reasonable, particularized suspicion of illega
drug-trafficking to briefly detain Garcia after the traffic
stop and deploy Loki around the vehicle. 2  See, e.g., id.
Bloomfield, 40 F.3d at 918-19.
Garcia argues Deputy Woodward did not have reasonable
suspicion because two of the factors the magistrate judge
relied on “are nothing more than evidence of innocent
and responsible travel.” In Garcia s view, the travelers
could have used the blanket to protect their valuables
from thieves and could have needed the air fresheners to
mask the odor of four adults travelling thousands of miles
by car in July. As for Karina s nervous behavior, Garcia
attributes that to her need to use the restroom. Garcia s
innocent explanations are reasonable, but his “divide and
conquer analysis” is precluded by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S

such a stop becomes unreasonable (and thus unlawful) i
officers prolong it beyond the time reasonably required

citations, quotation marks, and alterations omitted).
Simeon s motion challenges the legality of the stop itself by
alleging no speeding citation was issued. He is mistaken,
because a citation was in fact issued. He also alleges
the officers immediately began questioning the Impala s
occupants about luggage and consent to search, but this
mischaracterizes the evidence. Harrington s body camera
footage shows the encounter began as a relatively ordinary
traffic stop, with Harrington performing routine inquiries
related to speeding. Only after an extended period of time
and several intervening circumstances—the discovery of
an outstanding warrant against Simeon and the possibility
Columbus, Georgia would extradite Simeon based on
that warrant—did the officers inquire about luggage or
request consent to search. Harrington testified he paced
the Impala at seventy-four miles per hour (in a sixty miles
per hour zone) prior to stopping it, and Jacks admitted he
had been speeding. Nothing Simeon identifies undermines
the evidence the stop was legal at its inception.
*4  Simeon argues even if the stop was legal, it was
impermissibly long. His primary argument the length of
the traffic stop exceeded the permissible scope is Jacks
and the other passengers were allegedly detained along
with Simeon, and should have been allowed to leave with
the vehicle after Simeon s warrant was discovered. (Doc.
15 at 4). There are two ways this argument could be
interpreted (which Simeon s motion conflates, to some
extent, by referring to the unreasonable detention of
“the vehicle,” itself a thing with no Fourth Amendment
rights): (1) the Fourth Amendment rights of Jacks and
the other passengers were violated by the impermissibly
long detention, which justifies suppressing the evidence
as to Simeon; or (2) Simeon s Fourth Amendment rights
were violated when the Impala was not released after
it was clear he would be taken into custody. The
first of these potential interpretations can be dismissed,
because whether the delay was unreasonable as to Jacks
does not affect whether the delay was unreasonable as
to Simeon; Simeon cannot predicate his argument the
evidence should be suppressed on a violation of another
person s Fourth Amendment rights. See Alderman v.
United States, 394 U.S. 165, 171-172, 89 S. Ct. 961, 965,

officer ordered the driver out of the vehicle and had

Judge Mahoney correctly focused on “the totality of the

The prosecution contends that reasonable suspicion to

suspicion warranting the continued detention. See United

hunch). Accordingly, I accept Judge Mahoney s well

(citation omitted). Scruggs testified that, in his experience
as a drug interdiction officer, the “paint by numbers”
process of combining these seemingly innocuous factors
made him very suspicious. And indeed, two unrelated men
traveling across the country together to visit one man s
relative, for a vaguely described visit whose duration
lasted roughly as long as the round-trip travel, may have
provided a useful hunch for an experienced narcotics
investigator like Scruggs—particularly if the driver seems
to be nervous or evasive. 6
But, based upon the totality of the circumstances, the
factors relied upon by Scruggs did not in aggregate
establish reasonable suspicion that other criminal activity
was afoot at the time he ceased his initial questioning of
Defendant and went to question Gallo. One reasonable
suspicion determination is seldom a useful “precedent” for
another, United States v. Townsend, 305 F.3d 537, 542 (6th

is instructive here. There, an officer based his suspicion
determination on several factors: unusual behavior by the
defendant, including behaving extremely cooperatively;
dubious travel plans that involved late night travel; travel
between “source cities” for narcotics; the presence of
three cellular telephones and a Bible in the passenger
compartment, purportedly typical of drug couriers; rolls
of currency in the defendants  pockets; a previous weapons
charge arrest; nervous behavior; an automobile cluttered
with food wrappers and clothing; and a driver who was
not the registered owner of the car. Id. at 542–45. Finding
that “this case lacks any of the stronger indicators of
criminal conduct that have accompanied these minor
factors in other cases,” the Sixth Circuit rejected them
as the foundation for a reasonable suspicion of criminal
activity permitting their continued detention for a canine
drug sniff. Id. at 545.

Although the United States Constitution and the North

seizures, U.S. Const. amend. IV; N.C. Const. art. I, § 20
canine sniffs do “not constitute a ‘search’ “ for federa
and state constitutional purposes due to the minimal leve

other investigative procedure that is so limited both in the
manner in which the information is obtained and in the
content of the information revealed by the procedure,”
leading the Court to “conclude that [a canine sniff does
not constitute a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment”). For that reason, “once the lawfulness of
a person s detention is established [,] ... officers need
no additional assessment under the Fourth Amendment
before walking a drug-sniffing dog around the exterior of
that individual s vehicle.” State v. Branch, 177 N.C.App

implicate any state or federal constitutional concerns.

being stopped by a police vehicle,
there was a can of air freshener

this case are essentially indistinguishable from those we
held sufficient to establish the existence of the necessary
reasonable suspicion in Hernandez. In addition, in this
case, Officer Houpe knew of Defendant s prior drug
conviction. Although minor differences exist between the
facts at issue here and those under consideration in

reinforce our conclusion that the extension of Defendant s
detention was not unlawful. For example, the fact that
a vehicle is not registered to its occupants, the only

382, 387, 148 Ill.Dec. 7, 560 N.E.2d 309, 311 (1990). The
first tier involves an arrest of a citizen, which must be
supported by probable cause. The next tier involves a brief
seizure, also known as a “Terry ” stop. This brief seizure
must be supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal
activity. Murray, 137 Ill.2d at 387, 148 Ill.Dec. 7, 560

[11]  [12]  The United States Supreme Court extended
the Terry-type stop to canine searches of an individual s
luggage. Officers need to have reasonable suspicion that
contraband is present in the luggage prior to its detention
for a search of that type. United States v. Place, 462 U.S.
696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983). The Court
concluded:
“[W]hen an officer s observations lead him reasonably
to believe that a traveler is carrying luggage that
contains narcotics, the principles of Terry and its
progeny would permit the officer to detain the luggage
briefly to investigate the circumstances that aroused his
suspicion, provided that the investigative detention is
properly limited in scope.” Place, 462 U.S. at 706, 103

[15]  Following the decision in Place, Illinois courts have
also required an officer to have reasonable suspicion prior
to detaining luggage for a canine sniff. See People v. Steels,

addressed the issue of whether the reasonable suspicion
standard should be utilized before detaining an automobile
to conduct a search for contraband. The Third District,
however, has employed the standard in two such cases
holding the officers needed reasonable suspicion prior to
the detention. See People v. Perez, 288 Ill.App.3d 1037,

Supreme Court that a canine sniff search is unique and
“sui generis.” Since we have held that this type of search is
minimally intrusive to an airport traveler, we see no reason
to hold differently in an automobile case. Consequently,
we find that a police officer must have the reasonable
suspicion that contraband is present in an automobile
prior to its detention for purposes of a canine sniff search.
[16]  In considering whether reasonable suspicion existed
in this case, we look at the “totality of the circumstances.”

We find that the facts in Easley are significantly dissimilar
to the facts of this case. The facts in Perez are more
closely related to this situation; however, they are also
distinguishable. In Perez, the court affirmed the denial of
a motion to suppress evidence, finding that the officer had
sufficient reasonable suspicion to detain defendants for a
few additional minutes to allow a canine to arrive. The
court noted that the officer relied on the following factors
to detain the vehicle: (1) based on the officer s extensive
knowledge of and experience with trucks, he believed there
might be a compartment under the truck beneath the spare
tire; (2) the truck had a temporary registration sticker
as well as license plates; (3) defendant gave a “patently
implausible” explanation for his trip to California; and
(4) the passenger had a prior drug conviction. Perez, 288
Ill.App.3d at 1045, 224 Ill.Dec. 191, 681 N.E.2d at 178–79.
Perez is distinguishable for two reasons. First, the officer
noticed that the spare tire underneath the truck was much
lower than usual, indicating a hidden compartment and
believed the rear portion of the truck had been modified
in some way. Perez, 288 Ill.App.3d at 1040, 224 Ill.Dec.
191, 681 N.E.2d at 175. This fact is more suspicious
than an individual carrying mattresses on top of a tarp
in the back of a pickup truck. It is not unusual to
transport furniture in this manner and would not, in and
of itself, arouse the suspicions of a reasonable person.

gave a “patently implausible” explanation for his trip
to California suggesting that defendant was lying or
misrepresenting facts. In contrast, nothing in the record
here indicates that defendant gave false information to
Jennings or misrepresented the place of his destination.
Defendant told Jennings that he was going to Aurora and
the officer confirmed that the vehicle was registered *225
to an Aldofo Ferrer of Aurora, Illinois. Jennings testified
that defendant told him the truck belonged to a “friend”
and defendant had to read the owner s name off a piece of
paper. However, defendant testified that he promptly told
the officer that the truck belonged to his cousin. The trial
court is in the better position to analyze this testimony.
[18]  Finally, the fact that defendant was driving a truck
that belonged to another, was heading to Aurora on I–
55, was carrying mattresses and traveling with a passenger
who had a criminal history record, does not support a
finding of reasonable suspicion. The facts used to support
an investigatory detention are insufficient when they
“describe a very large category of presumably innocent
travelers, who would be subject to virtually random
seizures.” Reid v. Georgia, 448 U.S. 438, 441, 100 S.Ct.

the prosecution did not meet its burden of proving the
detention was justified and therefore granting defendant s
motion to quash arrest and suppress evidence was not
manifestly erroneous.

the deputies lacked the reasonable suspicion necessary to
extend the traffic stop beyond its initial purpose. 5  As
the Supreme Court made clear in Illinois v. Wardlow, an
officer must possess “a reasonable, articulable suspicion
that criminal activity is afoot” to execute a brief
“investigatory detention.” See 528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct.

The government now concedes that the de minimis ground
for denying the suppression motions is legally untenable.
As a result, the prosecutors recognize that their only viable
contention is that the district court correctly ruled that—
on this record—reasonable, articulable suspicion justified
the dog sniff of the Hyundai. To that end, they rely solely
on the factors identified by the court in the Superseding
Opinion.
A.
1.
[5]  [6]  [7]  Before evaluating the reasonable-suspicion
contention, we identify some pertinent legal principles
that bear on its resolution. A traffic stop constitutes
a “seizure” under the Fourth Amendment and is thus
subject to a reasonableness requirement. See Whren v.
United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135
L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Because a traffic stop is more akin to an
investigative detention than a custodial arrest, we analyze
the constitutionality of such a stop under the two-prong
standard enunciated in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct.
", "position":8 },
"15270":{"case_id":"15270", "opinion_id":"3351981", "text": "1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). See Arizona v. Johnson, 555
U.S. 323, 330–31, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009).
Pursuant thereto, we first determine whether the officer s
reason for the traffic stop was legitimate. See United States
v. Rusher, 966 F.2d 868, 875 (4th Cir.1992). Second, we
examine whether the officer s actions during the seizure
were “reasonably related in scope” to the basis for the
traffic stop. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).
[8]  In April of this year—while this appeal was
pending—the Supreme Court decided Rodriguez v. United
States, ––– U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 191 L.Ed.2d
492 (2015). Rodriguez held that, absent reasonable,
articulable suspicion of criminal activity, a detaining
officer may not extend an otherwise-completed traffic stop
in order to conduct a dog sniff. See id. at 1614–16. The
Court emphasized that, under Terry s second prong, the
“[a]uthority for the seizure ... ends when tasks tied to the
traffic infraction are—or reasonably should have been—
completed.” Id. at 1614. In other words, to extend the
detention of a *246  motorist beyond the time necessary
to accomplish a traffic stop s purpose, the authorities must
either possess “reasonable suspicion or receive the driver s
consent.” See United States v. Digiovanni, 650 F.3d 498,
507 (4th Cir.2011); United States v. Branch, 537 F.3d 328,
336 (4th Cir.2008).
2.
With respect to Terry s first prong—whether the reason
for the traffic stop was legitimate—Williams does not
dispute that Deputy Russell was entitled to stop the
Hyundai for speeding. On Terry s second prong—whether
the officers  actions were reasonably related in scope to
the basis for the traffic stop—it is similarly undisputed
that Russell had accomplished the purpose of the stop
before Deputy Soles decided to conduct the dog sniff of
the Hyundai. Furthermore, Williams did not consent to
a search of the vehicle. Thus, the propriety of extending
Williams s detention beyond the completion of the traffic
stop turns on whether reasonable, articulable suspicion
existed when Soles decided to conduct a dog sniff of the
Hyundai.

"15271":{"case_id":"15271", "opinion_id":"3351981", "text": "[9]  [10]  Reasonable suspicion is a “commonsen
nontechnical” standard that relies on the judgment
of experienced law enforcement officers, “not legal
technicians.” See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690,
695, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (internal
quotation marks omitted). To support a finding of
reasonable suspicion, we require the detaining officer
“to either articulate why a particular behavior is
suspicious or logically demonstrate, given the surrounding
circumstances, that the behavior is likely to be indicative
of some more sinister activity than may appear at first
glance.” See United States v. Foster, 634 F.3d 243, 248 (4th
Cir.2011).
[11]  [12]  Under the applicable principles, the releva
facts articulated by the officers and found by the trial
court, after an appropriate hearing, must “in their totality
serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent
travelers.” See United States v. McCoy, 513 F.3d 405,
413 (4th Cir.2008). As our McCoy decision explained,
however, each articulated fact need not “on its own
eliminate every innocent traveler.” Id. Rather, we “must
look at the totality of the circumstances of each case
to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized
and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.” See
United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct.
744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
B.
With this framework in mind, we briefly address the de
minimis contention and then turn to a comprehensive
analysis of the reasonable-suspicion question. The
prosecution contended in both hearings in the district
court that the officers  nearly three-minute extension of
Williams s detention—after completion of the traffic stop
—was for a constitutionally permissible de minimis period
of time. In each of its opinions, the district court agreed
with that proposition. In so ruling, each opinion relied
on our decision in United States v. Farrior, where we
recognized that a de minimis extension of the traffic
stop—during which an officer conducted a dog sniff
of Farrior s vehicle—was not “a violation of [Farrior s]
Fourth Amendment rights,” regardless of whether the

—the Defendants  use of a rental car—is of minimal value
to the reasonable-suspicion evaluation. Neither Deputy
Russell nor Deputy Soles explained any connection
between use of a rental car and criminal activity. We
will nevertheless accept that, as a general proposition,
some drug traffickers use rental cars. See, e.g., United
States v. Finke, 85 F.3d 1275, 1277 (7th Cir.1996) (noting
that officer was concerned about rental car because he
knew “drug couriers often used rental cars to avoid asset
forfeiture laws”); United States v. Thomas, 913 F.2d 1111,
1116 (4th Cir.1990) (“[I]llegal transport of drugs often
involves the use of rental cars traveling from source cities
such as Miami.”). It is similarly beyond peradventure,
however, that the overwhelming majority of rental car
drivers on our nation s highways are innocent travelers
with entirely legitimate purposes.
b.
The second factor relied on in the Superseding Opinion
—that the Defendants were traveling “on a known drug
corridor at 12:37 a.m.”—is the only factor that, on its
face, makes any reference to criminal activity. Similar to
traveling in a rental car, however, the number of persons
using the interstate highways as drug corridors pales
in comparison to the number of innocent travelers on
those roads. Furthermore, we are not persuaded by the
proposition that traveling south on I–85 late at night helps
narrow the identification of travelers to those involved in
drug activity.

highways such as I–85, but so do many more innocent
motorists. Put simply, the interstate highways are the
most efficient way to drive between two points in this
country, particularly large cities. Thus, although we
have recognized that law enforcement officers and the
trial courts are entitled to consider a motorist s use
of an interstate highway as a factor in determining
reasonable suspicion, we are entirely satisfied that such
an observation, standing alone, is entitled to very little

Cir.2005) (observing that prosecution had acknowledged
that travel between known drug source and known
drug destination was weak factor in reasonable-suspicion
analysis).
Because there is nothing inherently suspicious about
driving at night on an interstate highway, police officers
must rely on their training and experience to link
interstate-highway travel to more specific characteristics
of narcotics trafficking. See, e.g., United States v. Brugal,
209 F.3d 353, 359–60 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc) (plurality

on his knowledge and experience, drug couriers fly to
Miami from a northern destination, such as New York,
to obtain drugs, rent a vehicle, and return north with the
drugs”); United States v. Foreman, 369 F.3d 776, 784–85
(4th Cir.2004) (explaining that officer s experience with
drug interdiction showed that particular highway was

however, offered no evidence in either of the suppression

trafficking. 6

night. Nor is there support for the proposition that

[17]  Due to the fact-specific nature of the reasonable
suspicion inquiry, see United States v. Demoss, 279 F.3d
632, 636 (8th Cir.2002), it would be inappropriate for us to
peruse appellate decisions for connections that Deputies
Russell and Soles failed to draw. As we observed in
Branch, “context matters” in the reasonable-suspicion
inquiry because “actions that may appear innocuous
at a certain time or in a certain place may very well
serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different
circumstances.” See 537 F.3d at 336. It follows that a
determination that a certain fact is suspicious in one
case does not compel the conclusion that the same fact
is suspicious in other cases. See, e.g., United States v.
Richardson, 385 F.3d 625, 630 (6th Cir.2004) (recognizing
that, although nervousness has sometimes been utilized in
finding reasonable suspicion, “it is an unreliable indicator,
especially in the context of a traffic stop”).
*249  The Superseding Opinion relied on two Tenth
Circuit decisions in deeming the midnight hour of the
traffic stop a relevant factor in its reasonable-suspicion
analysis. See United States v. Clarkson, 551 F.3d 1196
(10th Cir.2009); Gallegos v. City of Colo. Springs, 114
F.3d 1024 (10th Cir.1997). Our examination of those
cases illustrates the problem with relying mainly on court
decisions, as opposed to testimony from officers in the
particular case, to identify certain facts as suspicious.
First, the Clarkson decision involved a latenight stop of
a vehicle that the police had just seen parked in front of
a house that was under surveillance for suspected drug
dealing, violent crime, prostitution, and gang activity. See
551 F.3d at 1198. After stopping the vehicle, an officer
observed that the passenger appeared to be under the
influence of narcotics. Id. at 1199. Second, in the Gallegos
case, police officers had responded to calls reporting a
“prowler” and an inebriated man arguing with a woman.
See 114 F.3d at 1029. Those officers then observed
Gallegos, who reeked of alcohol and was “acting in a very
unusual fashion.” Id.
In each of those decisions, the Tenth Circuit relied on
the nighttime hour as one of several factors that—taken
together—established reasonable, articulable suspicion of
ongoing criminal activity. See Clarkson, 551 F.3d at 1202;

public drunkenness are plainly more prevalent at night
than during the day. By contrast, it is far from self-evident
that interstate trafficking of drugs or other contraband
is more common at night. This record does not make
an evidentiary connection between nocturnal travel and
drug trafficking, either alone or in combination with
the other factors identified in the Superseding Opinion.
Absent such a connection, that the traffic stop of Williams
occurred at about 12:37 a.m. does not contribute to
a reasonable, articulable suspicion for extending the
otherwise-completed traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff.
c.
[18]  The Superseding Opinion s analysis of its third factor
focused on what the district court characterized as the
“inconsisten[cy]” between Williams s travel plans and the
due date for return of the rented Hyundai. Williams
had advised the deputies that he and his girlfriend were
planning to stay in Charlotte for a few days, but the
rental agreement reflected that the Hyundai was due to
be returned that afternoon in New Jersey. Williams also
said that he would extend the rental agreement when he
arrived in Charlotte. We therefore assess how the expiring
rental agreement, and Williams s explanation of it, impact
the reasonable-suspicion analysis.
In the Tenth Circuit s Santos decision, the defendant
had “rented a car in California on January 10, was
in Wyoming on January 13, and proposed to drive
to New York and back despite a January 17 ‘due
date’ in his rental agreement for returning the car to
California.” See 403 F.3d at 1129. The court of appeals
agreed that “[i]mplausible travel plans can contribute to
reasonable suspicion,” but prudently emphasized that the
prosecution had “presented no evidence that extending
the car rental period would entail any financial penalty,
or even any increase in the rate.” Id. (footnote omitted).
“Common experience suggests,” the Santos decision
recognized, that law-abiding rental car users frequently
“extend the rental without incurring a penalty or paying
a higher rate.” Id. The Superseding Opinion similarly
acknowledged that “[t]here are certainly a ‘large number
of innocent travelers who extend their trips beyond the
", "position":11 },
"15280":{"case_id":"15280", "opinion_id":"3351981", "text": "time originally provided for in their rental agreements.’
” See Superseding Opinion 25–26 *250  (quoting United
States v. Boyce, 351 F.3d 1102, 1110 n. 6 (11th Cir.2003)).
We agree with that proposition. Put simply, planning to
extend a rental agreement “may suggest that the driver s
travel plans are uncertain or subject to change, but,
without more, not that they are implausible.” See Santos,
403 F.3d at 1129.
Mindful that innocent travelers frequently extend rental
agreements, we turn to the record in this case. Deputy
Soles did not mention the rental agreement at either
hearing. Deputy Russell testified at the initial hearing that
the Hyundai was “due back [in New Jersey] that same
day, and [Williams] was traveling away from there. That
seemed odd to me.” J.A. 39. As in Santos, Russell failed to
explain how the rental car s due date was suspicious. When
Russell mentioned to Williams that the Hyundai was due
in New Jersey later that day, Williams replied promptly
that he and MacMullen would renew the rental agreement
in Charlotte. Cf. United States v. McRae, 81 F.3d 1528,
1535 (10th Cir.1996) (noting that McRae s “evident lack
of concern,” “unusually cavalier attitude,” and “vague
response” regarding how he would return his rental car
“correctly contributed to a reasonable suspicion in a
trained and experienced officer”). Moreover, as Russell
knew during the traffic stop, the Hyundai had been rented
through Hertz, a well-known car rental business with
locations most everywhere.
We do not doubt that the third factor, if it had
been “keyed to other compelling suspicious behavior,”
might contribute to an experienced officer s reasonable
suspicion. See Digiovanni, 650 F.3d at 513. But no
reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminality arises from
the mere fact that Williams s travel plans were likely to
exceed the initial duration of the rental agreement.
d.
[19]  The Superseding Opinion s fourth factor specified
that “Williams was unable to provide a permanent home
address in New York even though he claimed to live there
at least part-time and had a New York driver s license.”
That assertion, however, does not fully describe what

"15281":{"case_id":"15281", "opinion_id":"3351981", "text": "occurred during the traffic stop. Although the district
court related that Williams had failed to provide either
Deputy Russell or Deputy Soles with his home address,
the record shows that neither deputy asked Williams for it.
Distilled from the Superseding Opinion s unwarranted
inference that Williams was unable to provide a home
address, the fourth factor has three aspects: (1) when asked
for an address, Williams gave a post office box address; (2)
the address Williams provided differed from the address
on his driver s license; and (3) Williams told the deputies
that he lived in both New York and New Jersey. Neither
Deputy Russell nor Deputy Soles explained how using a
post office box address, or living in New York and New
Jersey, raised some suspicion of criminal activity. In fact,
neither officer identified any aspect of the fourth factor as
suspicious. Although it is somewhat ambiguous, the only
evidence regarding the significance of the post office box
address suggests that the address did not raise suspicion.
In response to a question on whether the post office box
address “affect[ed] [Russell] in the performance of [his]
duties to issue a warning ticket,” Russell said, “I put [the
post office box address] there because I could not get
[Williams s] formal address. That s where he received mail,
so I still wrote that for the warning.... It didn t affect. It
was just obscure.” J.A. 54.
Despite the deputies  failure to draw any suspicion from
Williams s post office box *251  address, the district
court hypothesized that the “different addresses and
[the] explanations” Williams gave for them “may have
legitimately raised suspicion.” See Superseding Opinion
22 (emphasis added). In connecting Williams s use of a
post office box address with possible suspicion, the court
relied on our unpublished decision in United States v.
Newland, 246 Fed.Appx. 180 (4th Cir.2007).
As with the second factor, cherry-picking “relevant
factor” findings from inapposite factual contexts bears
little fruit. Newland had furnished a driver s license from
the U.S. Virgin Islands and a rental agreement in his name
with a Maryland address, but advised the officers that he
lived in Washington, D.C. See Newland, 246 Fed.Appx.
at 182–83, 189. The officers suspected immediately—and
correctly—that the Virgin Islands license was fraudulent.

circumstances, we concluded that three different addresses
—including one on a fake driver s license—reasonably

at the suppression hearing, the officers “described in
some detail the reasons for their suspicions about Mr.
Newland s license.” Id. at 188. Nothing in Newland
suggests, however, that receiving mail at a different
address from that shown on the recipient s driver s license
provides a reasonable basis for suspicion.
Put succinctly, Deputies Russell and Soles failed to
develop the fourth factor with Williams during the traffic
stop and offered no explanation of how that factor
contributed to any reasonable suspicion. Absent some
factual underpinning, the significance of the fourth factor
collapses.
2.
As explained above, each of the factors relied on in the
Superseding Opinion—standing alone—fails to support
any reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity.
That analysis does not end our inquiry, however, because,
as we have recognized, “reasonable suspicion may exist
even if each fact standing alone is susceptible to an
innocent explanation.” See McCoy, 513 F.3d at 413–
14. Under the applicable standard, the facts, “in their
totality,” should “eliminate a substantial portion of
innocent travelers.” Id. at 413. Furthermore, an officer
must “either articulate why a particular behavior is
suspicious or logically demonstrate, given the surrounding
circumstances, that the behavior is likely to be indicative
of some more sinister activity than may appear at first
glance.” See Foster, 634 F.3d at 248.
a.
[20]  According to the Superseding Opinion, reasonable
suspicion existed because the four factors, “taken
together[,] ... eliminate a substantial portion of innocent
travelers.” See Superseding Opinion 31. In pressing the
contrary conclusion, Williams relies on our decision in

"15283":{"case_id":"15283", "opinion_id":"3351981", "text": "Digiovanni. There, we rejected the government s appeal
and affirmed a suppression ruling based on a Fourth
Amendment violation. The officer in Digiovanni sought to
rely on ten factors, including some that are similar to those
in the Superseding Opinion. For example, Digiovanni was
driving a rental car on I–95, which was characterized as
“a known drug corridor.” See 650 F.3d at 512–13. When
asked about his travel itinerary, Digiovanni described an
“unusual” route that included various stops to visit family
members. Id. at 502–03, 512–13.
*252  To be fair, Digiovanni s plan to ride the “Auto
Train” for part of his trip, which would have temporarily
separated him from his vehicle, “cut [ ] against the
government s argument” for reasonable suspicion. See
Digiovanni, 650 F.3d at 513. Of importance, however,
the officer specified two other factors that—in context—
were relevant to the reasonable-suspicion analysis. First,
Digiovanni had flown one-way into Florida—“a known
drug source state”—and rented a car for the return trip
to the northeast. Id. at 512–13. Second, “Digiovanni s
hands were trembling when he handed over his driver s
license and the rental [car] contract.” Id. at 512. Our
Digiovanni decision observed that the officer was “entitled
to rely to some degree” on those two factors, in addition
to others. Id. at 512–13. Nonetheless, Judge Hamilton
concluded that “reasonable suspicion was not present
to turn [Digiovanni s] routine traffic stop into a drug
investigation.” Id. at 513. At bottom, all the authorities
could “link to the unusual travel itinerary” was that
“Digiovanni rented a car from a source state, was stopped
on I–95, and was initially nervous.” Id.
Our Digiovanni decision is consistent with the
Eleventh Circuit s decision in Boyce. In that case,
the court evaluated circumstances that are materially
indistinguishable from the first three factors relied on in
the Superseding Opinion: Boyce was “driving a rental
car on a known drug corridor [I–95],” and “planning to
return the car two days late,” that is, his stated travel
plans exceeded the duration of the rental agreement.
See 351 F.3d at 1109. 7  The Eleventh Circuit ruled
that those factors, in their totality, were insufficient to
create reasonable suspicion because they “would likely
apply to a considerable number of those traveling for

Neither Digiovanni nor Boyce dealt with the fourth factor
specified in the Superseding Opinion—dual residency and
differing addresses. On this record, however, that factor
does not tip the balance. It is not atypical for a person
to receive mail at an address other than the one on his
driver s license, nor is it uncommon for a person to receive
mail at his employer s address. And many businesses
receive their mail at post office box addresses—one need
only leaf through the nearest magazine or journal for a
subscription insert. Finally, the fact that Williams was
splitting time between residences in New York and New
Jersey is unremarkable.
Stated simply, the Superseding Opinion s four factors—
in the aggregate—fail to eliminate a substantial portion
of innocent travelers. Because the applicable standard
requires such a showing, the government s contention fails
to pass constitutional muster. 8
b.
Even if the Superseding Opinion s four factors were to
eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers,
Williams would yet prevail. The deputies neither
articulated *253  how Williams s particular behavior was
suspicious nor logically demonstrated that his behavior
was indicative of some more sinister activity than
appeared at first glance, as our Foster decision requires.
[21]  It is well settled that, in the reasonable-suspicion
inquiry, we “credit the practical experience of officers who
observe on a daily basis what transpires on the street.”
See Branch, 537 F.3d at 336–37 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Nevertheless, officers must apply their
experience so that the courts can make informed decisions
on whether their suspicions are reasonable. See Foster,
634 F.3d at 248 (explaining that “an officer and the
Government must do more than simply label a behavior
as ‘suspicious  to make it so”). Were it otherwise, an
experienced police officer s recitation of some facts,
followed simply by a legal catchphrase, would allow
the infringement of individual rights with impunity. See

inclination of the Government toward using whatever

suspicious activity” (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Put simply, our precedent requires that the authorities
articulate or logically demonstrate a connection between
the relevant facts and criminal activity. See Foster, 634
F.3d at 248.
This record fails to show how the four factors—separately
or cumulatively—reasonably pointed to criminal activity.
At the initial hearing, Deputy Soles testified generally that,
prior to ordering the dog sniff, “I had already kn [own] and
seen for myself indicators commonly associated with those
that are involved in criminal activity.” See J.A. 86. He
later explained, in a conclusory fashion, that officers may
“ask for consent to search” or “conduct a K–9 scan” when
“we see indicators commonly associated with those that
are involved in criminal activity, and[,] due to the totality
of those circumstances that we see during that stop[,] [we
believe] that criminal activity may be afoot.” See id. at
92. Deputy Russell testified in the reconsideration hearing
that the factors mentioned in his police report “drew [his]
suspicion,” but he did not identify those factors or further
elaborate on how they were connected to criminal activity.
See id. at 227–28. We do not question the experience of
these officers, but the prosecution is obliged to present
evidence articulating reasonable suspicion.
Having assessed de novo the reasonable-suspicion
question, we are simply not convinced that Deputies
Russell and Soles possessed a reasonable, articulable
suspicion of criminal activity during the traffic stop.
Extending the otherwise–completed stop of the Hyundai
to conduct a dog sniff thus contravened the Fourth
Amendment.

returned Matthews s documents and issued a warning

here. 3  Matthews questions the propriety of his detention
after the officer had returned his documents to him and
issued a warning citation. Matthews argues that because
these latter acts ended the investigation that had justified
the stop, at that point in time, the officer had no right
to detain him any longer, ask him questions, or search
the vehicle, as the officer lacked any “particularized

[2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8]  *56  “[T]o j
additional questioning of a driver and the search of his
vehicle following a routine traffic stop, an officer must
have reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct.” 4
To satisfy this “reasonable suspicion” standard, the
officer s investigation must be justified by specific
articulable facts sufficient to give rise to a reasonable
suspicion of criminal conduct. Articulable suspicion
requires a particularized and objective basis for
suspecting that a citizen is involved in criminal activity.
Although this suspicion need not meet the higher
standard of probable cause, it must be more than a mere
caprice or a hunch. In sum, when a traffic stop has
been completed and the officer questions and detains
a suspect for other reasons, he must have reasonable
suspicion of other criminal activity. 5
A police officer may lengthen the detention for further
questioning beyond that related to the initial stop if he has
an “objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion illegal
activity has occurred or is occurring.” 6
To determine whether a reasonable articulable
suspicion exists, courts must look to the totality of
the circumstances. Based upon that whole picture
the detaining officers must have a particularized and
objective basis for suspecting the particular person
stopped of criminal activity. Among the circumstances
for the court to analyze are objective observations,
information from police reports, if such are available,
and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation
of certain kinds of lawbreakers. 7
“The State bears the burden of proving that the search of
the car was lawful, and to carry this burden, the State must
show that it was lawful to detain [Matthews] until the time
the drug dog indicated the presence of drugs.” 8

because, **519  among other things, the officer observed
that Matthews was extremely nervous, was driving a
borrowed vehicle, and was traveling out of state but had
no luggage. But this court has held that similar facts
did not provide “a particularized and objective basis

20, like any other route, may be traveled upon to transport
illegal substances, many law-abiding citizens routinely
utilize that major thoroughfare for legal purposes, such as
travel to school and work; 10  there was no testimony that
Matthews s destination, like the city of his origination,

told the officer that he had visited a cousin in Atlanta,

Appellant concedes that an olfactory inspection by a
police dog does not offend the Fourth Amendment. His
complaint focuses on the reasonableness of the continued
detention. Officer Beauchamp issued two warnings to
appellant, but continued to detain him after telling him he
would be free to leave. Officer Beauchamp testified that he
decided not to arrest appellant for driving with a revoked
license. It was not until appellant refused consent to search
the car that Officer Beauchamp ordered appellant not
to leave and retrieved his police dog. Appellant argues
that Officer Beauchamp concluded his investigation of the
traffic stop when he issued the two warnings, and at that
time he did not have sufficient facts to create a reasonable
suspicion that appellant was hiding narcotics. Appellant
further argues that because Officer Beauchamp did not
have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity it was
unreasonable to continue to detain him for the canine
search.
The State argues that Officer Beauchamp had a reasonable
suspicion that appellant was transporting drugs and
therefore could continue to detain appellant. The State
cites an opinion from the Texarkana Court of Appeals in
support of its position. See Powell v. State, 5 S.W.3d 369,
378 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 1999, pet. ref d), cert. denied,
529 U.S. 1116, 120 S.Ct. 1976, 146 L.Ed.2d 805 (2000).
In Powell, two police officers stopped the defendant for a
traffic violation. During the traffic stop, the police officers
developed a reasonable suspicion that Powell was carrying
drugs. After issuing a citation for the traffic violation, the
police continued to detain Powell for further investigation.
The police based their reasonable suspicion on Powell s
nervousness, his statements that conflicted with those
of his passengers, his lying about not having any prior
arrests, his lack of registration for the car, and the fact
that one passenger had a prior drug offense. Id. Further,
one of the officers testified that these factors were common
to drug carriers. The Texarkana court found these factors
sufficient to establish a reasonable suspicion to continue
to detain Powell for further investigation of a drug-related
offense. Id.

a warning for the offense, Mohmed mentioned that the
car was rented. Id. The officer went to the passenger side
of the car and asked the passenger for the rental papers.
*257  While standing by the passenger door the officer

olfactory search of the outside of the car. The dog detected
the presence of drugs which were later found in the trunk.
Id. We held the smell of marijuana created a reasonable
suspicion for the officer to continue to detain Mohmed for
an investigation of drug possession. Id. at 628.
While the case before us is similar to Powell and Mohmed,
there are important distinctions preventing us from
reaching the same conclusion. Here, Officer Beauchamp
suspected appellant of hiding narcotics in the car because
he was very nervous during the traffic stop; he and his
passenger gave conflicting accounts about how long they
had been visiting Dallas; and he drove a rental car not
issued to him or his passenger. Officer Beauchamp also
testified that these factors are common in cases where the
driver of a car is transporting illegal drugs. Unlike Powell,
however, Officer Beauchamp did not catch appellant
lying or discover any prior drug offenses. Also, unlike
Mohmed, Officer Beauchamp testified that he did not
smell marijuana coming from the car while standing at the
passenger door.
The State also cites to several other cases from
the various intermediate courts of appeals to prove
Officer Beauchamp had a sufficient basis to form
reasonable suspicion. See Simpson v. State, 29 S.W.3d
324, 329 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet.
ref d) (appellant exited car immediately after being
stopped without being asked and approached patrol car,
gave abrupt and unsure answers to officer s questions,
was nervous, and misstated criminal history); Martinez
v. State, 29 S.W.3d 609, 612 (Tex.App.—Houston
[1st Dist.] 2000, pet. filed) (appellant and passenger
told conflicting stories, and appellant did not know
passenger s name); Zervos v. State, 15 S.W.3d 146, 152–
53 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 2000, pet. ref d) (appellant was
extremely nervous, pacing, fidgeting, gave contradictory
", "position":8 },
"15326":{"case_id":"15326", "opinion_id":"3351983", "text": "statements). The detentions in these cases were reasonable
because the officer was in the midst of conducting the
investigation for the initial traffic stop. However, in this
case Officer Beauchamp had dismissed his suspicion that
appellant was intoxicated and issued two warnings for
the traffic violations, thus concluding the purpose of the
initial stop. See Davis, 947 S.W.2d at 245. Also, he was
no longer inquiring into the areas permitted by Mohmed
during a traffic stop. See Mohmed, 977 S.W.2d at 628.
Therefore, before issuing the warnings Officer Beauchamp
needed sufficient facts to reasonably suspect appellant was
hiding narcotics to permit further detention for the canine
search.
[16]  The confusion associated with the rental ca
agreement would most likely indicate that the vehicle was
stolen, as opposed to containing drugs. See United States
v. Dortch, 199 F.3d 193, 199 (5th Cir.1999). But Officer
Beauchamp did not testify that he was investigating a
stolen vehicle. Also, appellant s nervousness is a weak
indicator of hidden narcotics. Even Officer Beauchamp
admitted that sometimes people are nervous when he stops
them late at night on Interstate 35. We recognize that
the law allows Officer Beauchamp to consider the totality
of the circumstances with his personal experience when
forming a reasonable suspicion. But even taking that into
consideration, a reasonable suspicion that appellant was
hiding narcotics in the car could not be rationally inferred
from these facts. Without a reasonable suspicion that
appellant possessed narcotics, when he gave appellant the
warning citations, it was unreasonable to continue his
detention for the canine *258  search. After reviewing the
evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court s
ruling, we hold that the trial court incorrectly denied
appellant s motion to suppress.

We consider the source and nature of the error, the extent

Trooper Engum s testimony that he smelled a strong
odor of burnt marijuana during his first contact with the
Suburban is not credible for several reasons.
[1]  First, Trooper Engum was aware that it would take
some time for a canine unit to arrive at the location of
the stop, yet he waited more than five minutes from the
time he first returned to his squad car *859  after allegedly
smelling the strong odor of marijuana until he called for
the canine unit. As Trooper Engum was undoubtedly
aware, unnecessary delay may transform an investigative
stop 5  into a de facto arrest, and therefore he was obligated
to act promptly in response to the alleged odor. See United
States v. Bloomfield, 40 F.3d 910, 917 (8th Cir.1994) (en
banc); see also United States v. Donnelly, 475 F.3d 946,
954 (8th Cir.2007) (distinguishing a case in which officers
knew that they would need a drug-sniffing dog but “did
nothing to ensure one s presence” from one in which
the officer called for a drug-sniffing dog “immediately
after he developed a reasonable suspicion of narcotics
possession”).
Second, Trooper Engum failed to mention the alleged
odor of marijuana during his first telephone conversation.
During the five minutes between his first opportunity
to radio for a canine unit and his actual radio call,
Trooper Engum had a one-minute and twenty-four
second telephone conversation with members of the
Headwaters Safe Trails Task Force, which is responsible
for enforcing drug trafficking laws. Trooper Engum called
", "position":17 },
"15336":{"case_id":"15336", "opinion_id":"3351984", "text": "them because he knew the Task Force was investigating
Dolson. He testified that he contacted them so that they
would “be aware that [he] was out with Jeff Dolson
because it could pertain to another ongoing investigation
that was being conducted at that time.” (Docket No. 37 at
46.) If Trooper Engum had in fact smelled a strong odor of
burnt marijuana before placing that call, it seems logical
to expect that Trooper Engum would have mentioned his
findings and his intent to call for a canine unit to the
members of the Task Force, because such findings would
likely “pertain to” the Task Force s ongoing investigation.
Cf. United States v. Ross, 300 Fed.Appx. 386, 390 (6th
Cir.2008) (concluding that the officer s testimony that he
had smelled marijuana during his first contact with the
vehicle was credible because “[w]hen Dettmer returned
to his patrol car with Ross s license and registration, he
immediately told [his partner] Hanes that he had smelled
marijuana in Ross s car and intended to investigate
further, with her assistance.” (emphasis added)). Trooper
Engum did not even offer the information after the Task
Force asked several questions about the stop, including
what Trooper Engum had on Dolson. (See Docket No.
37 at 61.) Instead, Trooper Engum responded, “[o]ther
than nervousness, not right now. Got two kids in the car
and.... I m gonna pinch him for no child seat.” On cross-
examination, Trooper Engum denied that the Task Force
had asked him whether he had sufficient justification for
a canine sniff or probable cause to search the car, (id.
at 46–47), but he provided no other explanation for his
statement, and the Court can think of no other plausible
explanation.
Trooper Engum s explanation for his failure to mention
the odor of marijuana is inconsistent with what he did
mention to the Task Force. Trooper Engum explained
on cross-examination that he did not mention the odor
of marijuana because the odor “doesn t mean that there s
product.... If there s product left or not that doesn t mean
I have nothing.” In other words, Trooper Engum believed
that the *860  odor of marijuana alone did not provide
sufficient justification to ticket Dolson or to search the
vehicle. Yet Trooper Engum was undoubtedly aware
that nervousness alone also would not provide sufficient
justification to ticket Dolson or to search the vehicle.
Nonetheless, he told the Task Force that Dolson was
“nervous as a whore in church” and responded to a
question about what he had on Dolson by stating, “Other

filtering his comments to the Task Force based on whether
certain observations would give rise to probable cause,
then Trooper Engum would have mentioned neither
Dolson s nervousness nor the odor of marijuana.
Third, the remainder of the telephone conversation
suggests that the Task Force provided Trooper Engum
with more substantive information than Trooper Engum
admitted in his testimony. After Trooper Engum stated,
“I m gonna pinch him for no child seat,” there was a
pause, then Trooper Engum stated, “Okay,” and then
there was a very long pause, after which Trooper Engum
replied, “Okay. All right. See ya.” Trooper Engum
testified that the only thing the Task Force asked was
that Trooper Engum “advise them when I was clear.
That s all they asked.” (Id. at 46.) Trooper Engum s
testimony is not consistent with the length of the pauses
in the videorecording or with Trooper Engum s responses
to them. The Court concludes that the videorecording
demonstrates that the Task Force asked or directed
Trooper Engum to do something more than simply
“advise them when [he] was clear.”
Trooper Engum s conduct after completing the call
provides further support for the Court s conclusion. After
completing the call, Trooper Engum exited the squad
car, had a forty-second conversation with the occupants
of the Suburban, and then returned to the squad car to
radio for a canine unit. As discussed in greater detail in
the following section, Trooper Engum s testimony about
the purpose of this second contact with the Suburban is
inconsistent with the videorecording. The Court concludes
that the most plausible explanation for the purpose of
Trooper Engum s second contact with the Suburban was
to place some temporal distance between his conversation
with the Task Force, in which he stated “[o]ther than
nervousness, not right now,” and his call for the canine
unit. Trooper Engum was undoubtedly aware of two
relevant facts: (1) he could lawfully prolong the stop if
he needed to investigate the vehicle s registration, and (2)
his credibility would be undermined if, immediately after
concluding his call with the Task Force, he were to call for
a canine unit, because the timing of those calls would give
rise to an inference that the Task Force had instructed him
to do so.

Engum s Testimony
Each of the aforementioned inconsistencies and
mischaracterizations, viewed in isolation, might not
undermine Trooper Engum s credibility. Viewed as a
whole, however, they demonstrate that Trooper Engum
has—whether deliberately or unintentionally—shaded the
facts surrounding the traffic stop in a way that would
make the search and seizure less constitutionally suspect
than it in fact was. Cf. United States v. Portmann, 207
F.3d 1032, 1033 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Therefore,
the Court makes the following additional factual findings
regarding Trooper Engum s testimony.
The Court concludes that during Trooper Engum s first
contact with the Suburban, he did not smell a strong
odor of burnt marijuana and he intended only to ticket
Dolson for failing to place the children in child restraints.
Trooper Engum offered no credible explanation for the
inconsistency between the purported odor of marijuana
and his conduct and statements to the Task Force when
he first returned to the squad car. See United States v.
Hatcher, 275 F.3d 689, 692 (8th Cir.2001) (per curiam).
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum s references to
the odor of marijuana were a pretext for prolonging the
stop and for questioning Dolson about drugs.
The Court concludes that the vehicle registration issue did
not cause or justify any delay, because Trooper Engum
was aware of and investigated the issue during his first
contact with the vehicle. Trooper Engum s testimony to
the contrary appears to be a post-hoc attempt to justify

"15339":{"case_id":"15339", "opinion_id":"3351984", "text": "his delay in calling for a canine unit. The *864  Court
concludes that the actual reason Trooper Engum delayed
calling for a canine unit was because Trooper Engum did
not smell a strong odor of burnt marijuana during his
initial contact with the vehicle, and therefore he had no
reason to call for a canine unit.
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum was justifiably
concerned that Dolson might be armed after he removed
Dolson from the vehicle. Nonetheless, after careful review
of the videorecording, the Court concludes that Dolson
never refused Trooper Engum s directions to place his
hands on the hood of the squad car and never conducted
himself in a way that manifested any physical threat
to Trooper Engum. Trooper Engum s testimony to the
contrary constitutes an effort to justify his decision to
unholster his sidearm.
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum did not suspect
that the cylinder in Dolson s pocket was a weapon. His
testimony to the contrary constitutes an effort to justify
his interrogation of Dolson about the identity of the object
after the pat-down search had been completed and after
Dolson had taken a seat in the back of the squad car.
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum exaggerated
Dolson s alleged willingness to sit in the back of the squad
car. This exaggeration constitutes an effort to characterize
the circumstances of Trooper Engum s questioning of
Dolson after the pat-down as non-custodial.
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum repeatedly
mischaracterized when he questioned Dolson about the
last time someone smoked marijuana in the Suburban.
In so doing, Trooper Engum attempted to render that
question non-custodial. Trooper Engum also repeatedly
mischaracterized Dolson s response to the question in a
way that would corroborate Trooper Engum s testimony
that he smelled a strong odor of burnt marijuana coming
from the vehicle.
The Court concludes that Trooper Engum s testimony
about the canine sniff of the vehicle exterior is inconsistent
with the videorecording and with the canine handler s
report. Trooper Engum s testimony represents an effort to
present evidence corroborating his claim that he smelled
a strong odor of burnt marijuana during his first contact

A. The Seizure Was Unnecessarily Prolonged and Not
Supported by Reasonable Suspicion.
[12]  [13]  [14]  [15]  “We consider both the length of

of the detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying

occupants of the vehicle while the officer completes a
number of routine but somewhat time-consuming tasks
related to the traffic violation. A reasonable investigation
includes asking for the driver s license, the vehicle s
registration, as well as inquiring about the occupants 
*866  destination, route, and purpose.” United States
v. Suitt, 569 F.3d 867, 870–71 (8th Cir.2009) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, Trooper
Engum initiated the traffic stop because the vehicle did
not have a front license plate. In his initial contact
with the vehicle, he investigated that traffic violation
and conducted a reasonable investigation relating to that
traffic violation. During the course of that investigation,
he discovered that Dolson had children in the vehicle who
were not properly restrained and that Dolson did not have
proof of insurance. Therefore, he was authorized to ticket
Dolson for those additional traffic violations. When,
during the initial contact, Trooper Engum discovered that
the driver of the vehicle was not the owner associated with
the license plate number on the vehicle, Trooper Engum
properly proceeded to inspect the vehicle s VIN plate to
determine whether it matched the VIN associated with
the rear license plate. Trooper Engum s actions during
his first contact with the vehicle therefore were part of a
reasonable investigation conducted pursuant to the traffic
stop.
[17]  “To establish an unreasonably prolonged detention,
the defendant must show that the officer detained him
beyond the amount of time otherwise justified by the
purpose of the stop and did so without reasonable
suspicion.” Donnelly, 475 F.3d at 951–52. Therefore, the
Court first considers whether the length of detention was
justified by the purpose of the stop, and then considers
whether there was reasonable suspicion to prolong the
detention.
[18]  First, the Court finds that Trooper Engum detained
Dolson beyond the amount of time justified by the
purpose of the stop and the related traffic violations. See
Suitt, 569 F.3d at 870. “Whether a particular detention
is reasonable in length is a fact-intensive question, and
there is no per se time limit on all traffic stops.” Id. at 871
(internal quotation marks omitted). “Time is an important
factor in distinguishing between an investigative stop and

"15342":{"case_id":"15342", "opinion_id":"3351984", "text": "a de facto arrest ... [and] a stop may be too long if it
involves delay unnecessary to the legitimate investigation
of the law enforcement officers.” Bloomfield, 40 F.3d at
917 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).
If an officer does not act diligently in attempting to verify
his suspicions as quickly as possible, the detention may
be unreasonable. Id. at 917. More important than the
duration of the delay is “the unnecessary nature of the
delay.” Donnelly, 475 F.3d at 953 (emphasis added). Here,
Trooper Engum prolonged the detention in several ways:
he contacted the Task Force, he returned to the vehicle a
second time to ask additional questions, and he radioed
for a canine unit.
The Court concludes that, with one possible minor
exception, Trooper Engum detained Dolson beyond the
amount of time justified by the purpose of the stop and
the additional traffic infractions, and that such delay
was unnecessary. See id. at 951–52. Trooper Engum
testified that he returned to the vehicle “to inquire about
the ownership and check the VIN number.” (Id. at
47.) As noted above, Trooper Engum checked the VIN
plate during his first contact with the vehicle, and the
Court has concluded that Trooper Engum was aware
of the ownership issue at the time of the first contact.
Nonetheless, it is plausible that he returned to the vehicle
to inquire further about ownership. Such an inquiry
would be permissible. See Suitt, 569 F.3d at 871 (“When
there are complications in carrying out the traffic-related
purposes of the stop, ... police may reasonably detain a
driver for a longer duration than when a stop is strictly
routine. Reasonableness ... is measured in objective terms
by examining the totality of the circumstances.” (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration in
original)).
*867  Trooper Engum s other actions, however, were
not justified by the purpose of the stop and therefore
unnecessarily prolonged the stop. The only infractions
at issue involved a missing license plate, failure to
provide proof of insurance, and failure to use proper
child restraints. When Trooper Engum returned to his
squad car after observing these infractions, he spoke
with the Task Force for one minute and twenty-four
seconds. He testified that he contacted the Task Force
so that its investigators would “plainly be aware that
[he] was out with Jeff Dolson because it could pertain to
", "position":23 },
"15343":{"case_id":"15343", "opinion_id":"3351984", "text": "another ongoing investigation that was being conducted
at that time.” (Id. at 46.) Yet it is implausible that such
minor traffic offenses would be relevant to an ongoing
investigation by a Task Force enforcing drug trafficking
and violent crime laws. Similarly, radioing for a canine
unit and the resultant wait for the canine unit to arrive
unreasonably prolonged the stop. Asking Dolson to step
out of the Suburban, after Trooper Engum had already
had two uneventful encounters with Dolson and had
already written out the citations, further demonstrates
that Trooper Engum s conduct unreasonably prolonged
the stop. Compare Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106,
107–11, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (per curiam)
(holding that officer safety concerns justified the officer s
decision to order the driver to get out of the car even
without any reasonable suspicion of foul play at the time,
where the officer asked the driver “to step out of the car
and produce his owner s card and operator s license” at
the beginning of the stop); United States v. Roggeman, 279
F.3d 573, 575, 580 (8th Cir.2002) (concluding that there
was no Fourth Amendment violation when the officer
asked the driver to step out of the vehicle and sit in
the squad car while the officer issued the traffic citation)
with United States v. Oliver, 550 F.3d 734, 737–38 (8th
Cir.2008) (noting that even though an officer may direct
the driver to step out of the vehicle to perform a pat-
down upon reasonable suspicion that the driver may be
armed and dangerous, once the officer has decided “to let
the offending driver depart with a ticket, a warning, or
an all clear, then the Fourth Amendment applies to limit
any subsequent detention or search” (internal quotation
marks omitted)); United States v. Spotts, 275 F.3d 714, 719
n. 2 (8th Cir.2002) (“Officers who have conducted a lawful
Terry stop of a vehicle may order the driver to exit the
vehicle pending completion of the stop.” (emphasis added)).
[19]  Second, the Court finds that Trooper Engum did not
have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity sufficient
to expand the scope of his investigation to include the
potential presence of contraband. See Donnelly, 475 F.3d
at 952.
Trooper Engum provided two reasons for prolonging
the detention: Dolson s nervousness and the strong
odor of burnt marijuana coming from the vehicle
during Trooper Engum s initial contact. The Court has
concluded, however, that Trooper Engum s testimony
", "position":24 },
"15344":{"case_id":"15344", "opinion_id":"3351984", "text": "that he detected a strong odor of marijuana during this
initial investigation was not credible. 6  Therefore, *868
the Court finds that the only credible basis he had for
broadening his inquiry and prolonging the detention was
Dolson s nervousness.
[20]  Nervousness, without more, cannot “give rise to
reasonable suspicion” because “it cannot be deemed
unusual for a person to exhibit signs of nervousness when
confronted by an officer.” United States v. Guerrero, 374
F.3d 584, 590 (8th Cir.2004); see also Jones, 269 F.3d
at 928–29 (“[E]xtreme and unusually nervous behavior
observed in conjunction with only one or two other
facts can generate reasonable suspicion that criminal
activity is afoot. Generally, however, nervousness is of
limited significance in determining reasonable suspicion....
Because the government repeatedly relies on nervousness
as a basis for reasonable suspicion, it must be treated
with caution.” (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted)). Here, in particular, Dolson s behavior in “doing
a 180 in the driver s seat to face back towards the kids”
may be easily explained by the fact that Dolson had
two young children “playing” in the back seat area and
Trooper Engum was questioning Dolson about “the child
restraint issues.”
Because Trooper Engum unnecessarily prolonged the
detention without reasonable suspicion, the otherwise
lawful traffic stop became an unreasonable seizure in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. 7
